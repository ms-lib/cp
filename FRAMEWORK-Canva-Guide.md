# Content guide

#### What is content?

Great templates are built with high-quality content.

Content (in this case) is all the bits and pieces that make up your template design. It's the images, graphic elements, color, animations, copywriting, and videos. Knowing what choices to make depending on the kind of template you're building is really important.

When choosing content think about the following:  

-   Print or digital — Is the template going to be printed? Or viewed digitally?
    
-   Colors — How does digital or print output impact color choice?
    
-   Elements and graphics — How to choose the right ingredients.
    
-   Setting up for print — How to set up your template for the best print results.
    
-   Copy — Everything you need to know about safe-to-use content and Canva Ipsum resources.
    

#### Print or digital

When considering content, the most important question is whether the end use will be print or digital

When designing, you can categorize document types into two main categories – print and digital. Print is anything intended to be physically printed, and digital is anything that is ultimately viewed digitally or on-screen. Knowing where your template will end up will impact your content choices. For example, you don't want animations, movies, or buttons in a printed document.  

Choosing color for print document types

When designing for print, avoid colors outside the CMYK gamut range. This includes very bright, vivid, and neon colors, which will appear duller when printed.

#### Colors

Choosing the right colors for your design

If you find color overwhelming, try limiting yourself to two to three colors and use different shades or tints to add variation. Choose colors that contrast well with one another. Always check to make sure your text is easy to read. [Read more](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/) about color theory and color combinations.  

What is CMYK and RGB?

-   CMYK – refers to the print color model primarily used when printing in color. CMYK relates to the Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (black) inks. Because CMYK colors are made by mixing inks the tonal possibilities are more limited, resulting in duller color outputs when printed.
    
-   RGB – refers to the digital color model. Red, Green, and Blue light mix to create the digital color spectrum. RGB colors are made by mixing light and will produce colors with much brighter tonal variations.
    
-   HEX (or #) – Hexadecimal color values are color codes that specify RGB intensities in browsers. HEX color is specified with #RRGGBB.
    

When printing an RGB image, it will automatically convert to its CMYK equivalent. The resulting image will print much duller than expected. Check the color conversion prior to submission to avoid this.

##### Choosing color for print document types

When designing for print, avoid colors outside the CMYK gamut range. This includes very bright, vivid, and neon colors, which will appear duller when printed.

##### Color picking

Color pickers and the Canva Color Wheel are a good way to find and match color codes. If you know the CMYK or RGB values, a color picker will give you a HEX code to type directly into the Canva color palette.

![Presentation template showing different pages and how color can bee applied effectively.](https://content-management-files.canva.com/1a62081a-652f-4faf-885a-3e48f875ddf7/Colours_2.png)

##### Color consistency

Using consistent colors is important when designing multi-page documents. Replicating colors front to back or over multiple spreads allows for better comprehension of designs. A really easy way to stay consistent is to repeat color choices and use tonal variations.

#### Elements and graphics

Here are a few things that will help you choose and create great elements.

There are lots of things to think about when it comes to elements and graphics. Consistency is key. Unless you're creating your own, choosing elements with similar visual styles is important. By choosing elements that maximize customization, you can increase your templates' usability and downloads!  

![Meet the shapes poster showing appropriate element choices alongside an example of the same poster showing inappropriate element choices](https://content-management-files.canva.com/4bd7017e-d646-42a3-b2e2-07b20ce72556/elementsandgraphics_1.png)

##### Graphic Element consistency

When adding graphic elements, try to match the styles as closely as possible. In the example on the right, multiple illustration styles make the design feel busy and inconsistent. Keeping element choices consistent makes this design feel finished and considered.

![Meet the shapes poster showing appropriate element choices alongside an example of the same poster showing inappropriate element choices](https://content-management-files.canva.com/e8ffc927-f975-4130-8787-8cbc89fe7037/elementsandgraphics_12.png)

##### Graphic Element consistency

When adding graphic elements, try to match the styles as closely as possible. In the example on the right, multiple illustration styles make the design feel busy and inconsistent. Keeping element choices consistent makes this design feel finished and considered.

![Visual example of shapes being stacked on top of each other to 'create' a hacked together shape.](https://content-management-files.canva.com/35fb7a69-cc42-4a10-a6e4-f66442343e01/elementsandgraphics_2.png)

##### 'Hacked' elements

Shapes or illustrations built by combining many elements are considered 'hacked elements' and should be avoided. When creating custom shape elements, upload them to Canva as SVG file type, as this will allow users to edit the colors.

![Arrange palette in the Canva editor](https://content-management-files.canva.com/fd757a36-b0b3-49bd-8a6f-8217978d5cfe/elementsandgraphics_3.png)

##### Stacked elements

All the objects in your design should be easy to select and edit. These include graphics, text boxes, shapes, images, and videos. Ensure all objects are selectable by using the layer palette or arranging editable elements like text to the front.

![Replace background feature in the Canva editor](https://content-management-files.canva.com/87f7607c-5ad0-478e-b3ec-6a4affbfbad8/elementsandgraphics_4.png)

##### 'Attaching' background graphics

Adding photos or graphics to the entire background of your template can look great. To ensure other content in your template remains easily selectable, make sure you 'attach' the image to the background.

![Example of a customizable font beside a non-customizable font spelling 'fruits' ](https://content-management-files.canva.com/897ef1fa-51fe-4b0b-be7d-18611b3afb83/elementsandgraphics_5.png)

##### Non-customizable elements

When designing templates, customization should always be front of mind. While the execution of the word 'Fruits' to the right may look great visually, it's not the best choice as you can't easily customize it (it's not a font).

![Example of an intentional design choice of text bleeding off the sides of a template](https://content-management-files.canva.com/6c349505-2dec-4144-9990-2160bb779064/elementsandgraphics_6.png)

##### Using text as graphics

Make sure your design choice is intentional. Consider how easy the 'text' can be customized as a graphic. Ask yourself if a user might want to add additional text or change the word. Will this affect the text detrimentally and break the design layout? Sticking to the bounds of the artboard is advisable, but here are some examples of what you can do.

![Example of text box touching or extending outside of the page.](https://content-management-files.canva.com/58adb46e-7456-4249-ba49-8352c374a733/elementsandgraphics_7.png)

##### Using text as graphics

Avoid text boxes unnecessarily touching or extending outside the artboard - this is breaking the usability of the template. Also avoid extending the text box beyond the bounds of the artboard.

#### Setting up for print

It's important to check or 'pre-flight' any templates designed for print.

During pre-flight, you should check your file to make sure it contains all the elements and technical requirements necessary for a successful print run.  

Read the [Submission Checklist](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEpX3KHPjQ/LQxFEYplqX2IOqR-eNxCNg/view) for more information.  

![Example of show print bleed menu item alongside template that has bleed extended out correctly.](https://content-management-files.canva.com/dee89653-96ab-4c8a-9d54-4970a90c5083/settingupforprint_1.png)

##### Setting up Bleed

Print bleed is ink that runs beyond the trim edge of an artwork to ensure the color covers the entire finished print. Scale or move images/graphics that touch the edge of the document to extend past the edge of the page. Use View > Show Print Bleed to display this area.

![Margins refer to the empty space around the edge of a design. Good margins are important as they ensure all your content is within a 'safe zone'. Sticking to the safe zone means there is no risk of anything important being trimmed off once printed. Graphic elements can extend beyond the margin if they are decorative. You can turn on Margin Guides by clicking File > Show Margins.](https://content-management-files.canva.com/307deaf1-e288-4362-8633-2d72bd548f12/settingupforprint_2.png)

##### Margins and safe zone

Margins refer to the empty space around the edge of a design. Good margins are important as they ensure all your content is within a 'safe zone'. Sticking to the safe zone means there is no risk of anything important being trimmed off once printed. Graphic elements can extend beyond the margin if they are decorative. You can turn on Margin Guides by clicking File > Show Margins.

![Tri-fold brochures have three panels. Where the panels connect indicates the fold line. Avoid text and images running across this fold unless decorative](https://content-management-files.canva.com/6d172691-2380-4606-b4d9-7aa8d78a819c/settingupforprint_3.png)

##### Tri-fold brochure

Tri-fold brochures have three panels. Where the panels connect indicates the fold line. Avoid text and images running across this fold unless decorative

![If the document type contains folds, avoid placing text and images over the fold area](https://content-management-files.canva.com/47bfabc3-3355-460a-bbaa-c1b884028b13/settingupforprint_4.png)

##### Tri-fold brochure

If the document type contains folds, avoid placing text and images over the fold area. Text running over the fold will not only distort on the fold but also affect the ability for it to be printed.

![Business cards require a minimum of 7 pt for contact details; 8 pt if over a color background. Font choice will also dictate the minimum size requirement for legibility.

##### Minimum font size

Business cards require a minimum of 7 pt for contact details; 8 pt if over a color background. Font choice will also dictate the minimum size requirement for legibility. Script and decorative fonts will require larger minimum font size.

![It's best to stick to a white background when designing for clothing, apparel, and merchandise. A colored background in your template can mislead the user on color availability.](https://content-management-files.canva.com/5effb7ba-ddc4-45f0-8030-9d94838380d7/settingupforprint_6.png)

##### Clothing, apparel, and merchandise

It's best to stick to a white background when designing for clothing, apparel, and merchandise. A colored background in your template can mislead the user on color availability.

![When it comes to clothing and apparel, Canva allows for printing on black, white, or grey material. So consider if your template will work on these colored backgrounds.](https://content-management-files.canva.com/6c7f3a52-58f2-4dd5-91c5-7379119c3af8/settingupforprint_7.png)

##### Clothing, apparel, and merchandise

When it comes to clothing and apparel, Canva allows for printing on black, white, or grey material. So consider if your template will work on these colored backgrounds.

![When designing templates, especially smaller sizes that will be cut out (like stickers), it's important to consider the safe zone. This safe zone helps to ensure the design is trimmed correctly and doesn't look off-center once printed.](https://content-management-files.canva.com/cb2b07ca-d010-4c90-ad6a-1ddc841bbb6f/settingupforprint_8.png)

##### Stickers

When designing templates, especially smaller sizes that will be cut out (like stickers), it's important to consider the safe zone. This safe zone helps to ensure the design is trimmed correctly and doesn't look off-center once printed.

![Remember that any text, images, or elements that fall within the 'danger zone' are at risk of being trimmed off.](https://content-management-files.canva.com/9b4549c7-84b3-40b6-a66d-3ab2ee0babd3/settingupforprint_9.png)

##### Stickers

Remember that any text, images, or elements that fall within the 'danger zone' are at risk of being trimmed off.

![Borders in your design will emphasize any movement in the trim and can make a design reproduce incorrectly.](https://content-management-files.canva.com/bb69a20b-c7f6-42bc-9c43-146a074a55d6/settingupforprint_10.png)

##### Borders

Borders in your design will emphasize any movement in the trim and can make a design reproduce incorrectly. Use larger patterns, stick to the safe zone and consider asymmetrical or more organic styled borders.

Submitting print templates that do not print correctly may result in them being removed from the Canva library. Ensure you have carried out the correct print-ready checks and use the 'template assistant' prompts to assist.

Transparencies and effects

Although transparencies look great on screen and create unique effects, they can sometimes cause trouble on prints.

  

Common issues cause by transparencies include:  

-   The element may display a banding pattern.
    
-   The element may appear fuzzy.
    
-   An unwanted pattern may appear.
    
-   The element's color may change.
    
-   The element may lose its transparency.
    
-   Elements can drop out from your artwork.

##### Opacity

Avoid making elements fade or blend into the background

![Non-slip yoga mats poster with shadow and lift text effects.](https://content-management-files.canva.com/5a9f511a-a8de-4a16-8d23-19d05ea1bf6a/Transparenciesandeffects_2.png)

##### Drop shadows

Avoid using the Shadow and Lift text effects or any shadow elements

#### Safe-to-use copy

Copy shells

Copy shells are text templates you can freely use as a basis for your designs. Copy shells are 'safe-to-use' because we've made sure there's no risk of any copyright infringement or misattribution, this is particularly important when designing quotes and motivational posts. Please use the copy shells provided for your templates. **For more copy shell resources check out the mini guides resource section.**  

**Copy Resources**

#### 'In use' templates

**If you prefer to craft the text for your templates please ensure it's 'in use'**

'In use' refers to the intentional crafting of copy and elements within a template to align with its intended purpose. When the text in a template is designated as 'in use,' it serves as a guide for the end user, providing clarity on the template's intended function. This thoughtful approach not only helps users comprehend the purpose of the template but also offers valuable guidance during the editing process to tailor it to their specific needs. We strongly recommend incorporating 'in-use' copy into your templates (or using an appropriate copy shell), as it significantly enhances usability and encourages users to confidently engage with and utilize your designs.  

#### Lorem Ipsum

Lorem Ipsum is approved to use when copy blocks have more than 20 words.

Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface. Lorem Ipsum may be used as body copy placeholder text in your templates. Headings, subheadings and feature text need to remain 'in use' and should always reflect the design theme of your template.  

PLEASE NOTE: Speciality Creators require ALL information to be 'in use' to uphold the Speciality Guidelines. Do not use Lorem Ipsum.

![Social media template featuring Lorem Ipsum place holder text](https://content-management-files.canva.com/4d9a09bb-f51d-46f8-952d-a77534c89786/LoremIpsum.png)

##### When can't you use placeholder copy?

Blocks of text with 20 words or less are required to look 'in use'. This means the copy in the template must be written to match the template's design theme, no placeholder ipsum text will be accepted.

![Big Sale social media template featuring in-use and Lorem Ipsum place holder text](https://content-management-files.canva.com/c4608355-a1bc-4054-bc4c-1271b2d156e9/LoremIpsum2.png)

##### When can you use placeholder copy?

Headings, sub headings or any 'feature' text should appear 'in use' and match the templates design theme. In this example it's OK to use place holder text for the terms and conditions because the copy block is more than 20 words.

![Magazine template mixing 'in use' and Lorem Ipsum copy](https://content-management-files.canva.com/c6d73540-5594-4f17-a274-9f829436bafb/LoremIpsum3.png)

##### Mixing 'in use' and Lorem Ipsum copy

This example shows how you can mix 'in use' copy with Lorem ipsum. The blue boxes indicate the headings, subheadings or 'feature' text. This text should be written to match your templates design theme and appear 'in use'. The red boxes indicate larger banks of copy with more than 20 words. These can be Lorem Ipsum placeholder text.

![Magazine template mixing 'in use' and Lorem Ipsum copy example](https://content-management-files.canva.com/c23a91af-e051-4008-964a-d3dbd8e4c3d0/LoremIpsum4.png)

##### Mixing 'in use' and Lorem Ipsum copy

Remember it's always advisable that templates look 'in use'. 'In use' design will attract more downloads, so it's important to add as much detail as you can. Here's an example of a how a template can mix 'in use' and Lorem Ipsum copy.

Remember Headings, subheadings and all feature text needs to be customized to match your design theme. Blocks of text over 20 words can be placeholder Lorem Ipsum. PLEASE NOTE: Speciality Creators require ALL information to be 'in use' to uphold the Speciality Guidelines. Please avoid presentation Canva Ipsum & Lorem Ipsum.

-   Refers to extending your text box beyond the default size. By 'defining' your text box, you enable more control of how additional text flows in your template.
    

---

Legible

-   Refers to how easily you can read the template. You need to consider the end-user when checking legibility.
    

---

Reflow

-   Refers to how the text appears when adding or subtracting text to the template. You can check the reflow by adding additional text/characters and seeing how it affects the text box content.
    

---

CMYK

-   Refers to the print color model primarily used when printing in color. CMYK relates to the Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (black) inks.

---

Trim

-   Represents the final size of your design and indicates where a printer will cut or guillotine the page once printed.
    

---

Margins

-   Refers to the empty space around the edge of a design. Good margins are important as they ensure all your content is within the 'safe zone'. You can turn on Margin Guides by clicking File > Show Margins.
    

---

Focal Point

-   The part of a design which captures a viewer's attention first.
    

---

Weight
