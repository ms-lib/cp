# Metadata guide

#### Why are titles & keywords important?

They directly affect the searchability of your templates in Canva.

Your title and keywords are used to suggest your template to a user when they enter their search terms. Your aim is to have your template seen by the people who are looking for that type of content.  

#### Titles and Keywords

Titles should give a really good overall description of your template.

Keep your title short, and keep all the descriptive words in the Keywords. They should always be in Title Case.

  

A simple formula to follow when giving your template a title is:

**Color + Style + Subject + Category (Document type)**  

Keywords are the best way you can impact how visible your templates are.

Keywords should contain all the relevant descriptions of the template such as its color, style, texture, tone, composition, content, subject and category. A good way to think about it is in categories.

#### Education Creators

Titles should give a good overview of your educational content.

All templates must use the following title format.

**Subject** or **Use Case** **+** **Document Type** in **Colors** **+** **Style**  

Educational content is tagged at the publishing stage of your template.

The tags attributed to your template are selected by you at the publishing stage, and will include relevant information such as use case, subject, grade level and topic.
